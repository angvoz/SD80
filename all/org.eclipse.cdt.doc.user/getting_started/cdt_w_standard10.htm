<h3>Binary Parser Settings</h3>
<p>Click the <b>Binary Parser</b> tab, select the Binary Parsers you require for the project, and in which order they are to be used.  
<p>It is important you chose the proper parser settings to ensure the accuracy of the <b>C/C++ Projects</b> view and the ability to 
successfully run and debug your programs. 
After you select the correct parser for your development environment and build your project, 
you can view the symbols of the .o file in the <b>C/C++ Projects</b> view.</p>
