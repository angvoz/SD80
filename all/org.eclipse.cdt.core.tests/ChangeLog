2003-08-19 Sean Evoy
	In order to properly support the indexing feature, the scanner has to 
	function as well as the version that ships with the toolset if possible. 
	This is	made difficult by the fact that we are trying to be tool-agnostic. 
	One of the things that the scanner should take into account when it runs 
	is the "built-in" symbols and search paths that are defined for a compiler 
	in a given toolchain. While we need to come up with a standard mechanism 
	for the CDT in the future, the managed build system can provide a work-around 
	in the near-term. The easiest solution is to add an optional attribute to a 
	list element that flags the item as a built-in value. When clients like 
	the indexer query the build model, they will receive the union of the built-in 
	values and the user-defined values.
	
	Added built-in information to the existing plugin definition. Also added a
	new include path and defined symol for updated test cases.
	* plugin.xml
	
	Updated the test cases to check that built-ins defined in the plugin manifest 
	are properly read and dealt with during project creation and persisting settings.

	that creates a project the same way the new project wizard does. It uses
	the new discovery mechanism to find the scanner info provider.
	* build/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/managed/tests/ManagedBuildTests.java
