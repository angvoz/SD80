	Patch contains a fix for bug 43017. Renamed the "addDeps" method to a 
	more descriptive "addSourceDependencies". Added a flag when the 
	inter-project dependencies are calculated so that clean and all are 
	properly passed to the make invocation. Finally, I replaced the hard-coded
	'make' with $(MAKE)
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/MakefileGenerator.java
	
	It also contains some more work on 41826, specifically on the logic to
	implement a rebuild when the build settings change. The builder checks for 
	a build model change whenever a build is requested and responds appropriately. 
	The make targets (i.e. 'clean' and 'all') are also calculated differently now.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/GeneratedMakefileBuilder.java
	
	The build model was modified to set a dirty flag when an option changes. I also
	made a change to avoid an NPE when the build info was loaded.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/IManagedBuildInfo.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedBuildInfo.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java

	First submission of code to new project. Moved the managed builder 
	source code out of the cdt.core project. This includes the code to 
	implement the build model, along with the shema and extension point 
	declaration. Moved the builder, scnanaer info provider and managed 
	nature definitions into the package as well.
	
	There are 2 new classes to handle the externalized strings:
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuilderCorePlugin.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/PluginResources.properties
