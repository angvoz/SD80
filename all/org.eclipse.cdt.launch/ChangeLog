	Set the workspace directory default to be the Project.
	* src/.../internal/LocalCLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java (launch):
	Use the new function getWorkingDirectory(), it does more check by
	calling verifyWorkingDirectory().

	implemented.
	(getWorkingDirectory): New method, call verifyWorkingDirectory();
	(verifyWorkingDirectory): New method, does more checking.

	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/AbstractCLaunchDelegate.java (verifyCProject):
	If we cannot get the ICProject with the config, we get the project 
	and see if it exists and/or it is closed. The appropriate error is now
	displayed, rather than reporting that the project does not exist when it
	does exist, but is closed.

2002-11-14 Thomas Fletcher
	* src/.../launch/ui/CMainTab.java
	Updated error condition to catch closed projects.

	* src/.../launch/ui/CDebuggerTab.java
	Updated punctuation.

	* src/.../launch/ui/CDebuggerTab.java
	* src/.../launch/ui/CLaunchConfigurationTab.java
	* src/.../launch/ui/CorefileDebuggerTab.java
	Added support for supported cpus on a debugger and filters list based on
	selected IBinary.
	Default debugger selection is not the first exact matching debugger for 
	the specified platform.

	don't filter tab list based on mode since the configuration is shared with debug mode.

	* src/.../launch/internal/CoreFileLaunchDelegate.java
	* src/.../launch/internal/LocalCLaunchConfigur.ationDelegate.java
