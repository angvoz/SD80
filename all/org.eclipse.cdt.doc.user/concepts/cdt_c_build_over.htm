<h1>Building C/C++ projects</h1>

<p>The CDT uses the same make utility and makefile used on the command line. 
The CDT can generate makefiles automatically when you create a Managed Make C project or a Managed Make C++ project. 
You have the option of creating a Standard Make C project or a Standard Make C++ project and providing the makefile.</p>
<h2>Required utilities</h2>
<p>You must install and configure the following utilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build (such as <tt>make</tt>).</li>
  <li>Compile (such as gcc). For more information, see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">http://gcc.gnu.org</a>.</li>
  <li>Debug (such as gdb). For more information, see <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cygwin contains these utilities for a Windows environment, while running the cygwin installation ensure <tt>gcc</tt> and <tt>make</tt> are selected, they are not installed by default. 
For more information, see <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>. Red Hat users, all you need to build your project is included in the Red Hat Linux installation.
For other operating systems please refer to your installation documentation.</p>
</p>
<p>To test if your compiler was installed correctly open a command prompt or terminal window and type <tt>g++</tt> or <tt>make</tt>. 
An error message stating the command was not found or not recognized means that the utility is not installed or your path is not configured correctly.</p>  
<p>To check your path at a command prompt and the appropriate path command (i.e. enter <tt>PATH</tt> for windows users or <tt>echo $PATH</tt> for linux users).  Make sure that the path to your build utility is defined (example <tt>PATH=c:\cygwin\bin</tt>).<p>

<h2>Build terminology</h2>

<p>The CDT uses a number of terms to describe the scope of the build. </p>

<h3>Build Project</h3>

<p>This is an incremental build (make all). Only the components affected by modified files in that particular 
project are built.</p>

<h3>Rebuild Project</h3>

<p>Builds every file in the project whether or not a file has been modified since 
the last build. A rebuild is a clean followed by a 
build.</p>

<p>For more information on builds, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Concepts &gt; Workbench &gt; Builds</b></li>
  <li><b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Tasks &gt; Building resources</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Build-related information is displayed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The C-Build view displays the output of the make utility.</li>
  <li>The Tasks view displays a list of compiler errors and warnings related to 
  your projects.</li>
  <li>Makefile actions are displayed in the Make Targets view.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the Tasks view, see <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Reference &gt; User interface information &gt; Views and editors &gt; Tasks 
view</b>.</p>

<h2>Getting a makefile</h2>

<p>You can either create a C project for which you supply the 

<span class="filename">makefile</span> 
or create a C project for which the CDT generates makefiles automatically.
</p>

<p>To create a new project, from the menu bar choose 
<span class="guilabel">File > New > Project</span>.
In the dialog that appears:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To create a project for which you supply the <span class="filename">makefile</span>,
select either
<span class="guilabel">Standard Make C project</span> or 

<span class="guilabel">Standard Make C++ project</span>. 
</li>
<li>To create a project for which the CDT supplies a basic 
<span class="filename">makefile</span>, select either
<span class="guilabel">Managed Make C project</span> or 
<span class="guilabel">Managed Make C++ project</span>. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting build preferences</h2>

<p>You can set build preferences in Eclipse:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Build order</dt>
<dd>If certain projects must be built before others, 
you can set the <i>build order</i>. 
If your project refers to another project, the CDT must build the other project first.
To set the build order, from the menu bar select
<span class="guilabel">Window &gt; Preferences &gt; 
Build Order</span>.
<p>When you set the build order, the CDT does not rebuild projects 
that depend 
on a project; you must rebuild all projects to ensure all changes are 
propagated.
</p>

</dd>

<dt>Automatic save</dt>

<dd>You can set the CDT to perform an <i>automatic save</i> of all modified resources 
when you perform a manual build; from the menu bar, select 
<span class="guilabel">Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench</span>.
By default, this feature is disabled.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Controlling the building of your project</h2>

<p>The C/C++ compiler that a project uses is controlled by the project's 
<span class="guilabel">Properties</span> setting.
To view a project's properties, right-click on the project and select 
<span class="guilabel">Properties</span>.
In the dialog that appears, the 
<span class="guilabel">C/C++ Make Project</span> page enables you 
to control a variety of settings, including:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Build Setting</dt>

<dd>Controls whether the compiler will <span class="guilabel">Stop On Error</span>
or <span class="guilabel">Keep Going On Error</span>.
Choosing <span class="guilabel">Keep Going On Error</span> will force the compiler to 
attempt to build all referenced projects even if the current project has errors.
</dd>
<dt>Build Command</dt>
<dd>Controls which compiler is used.
By default the compiler is <span class="command">C Builder</span> 
(<span class="command">gcc</span>).</dd>

<dt>Workbench Build Behavior</dt>
<dd>Controls the auto-build on save feature and what operations
are performed during a build and rebuild.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <span class="guilabel">External Tools Builders</span> page
enables you to add, reorder, or remove external build tools.
</p>

<h2>Viewing build information</h2>

<p>Build-related information is displayed as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <span class="guilabel">C-Build</span> view displays the output of the make utility.</li>
<li>The <span class="guilabel">Tasks</span> view displays a list 
of compiler errors and warnings related to your projects.  
</li>
<li>Build actions display in the <span class="guilabel">Make Targets</span> view.</li>
