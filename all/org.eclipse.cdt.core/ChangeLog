	Some of the native functions were throwing exceptions
	particularly on the windows platform and it was not
	clearly advertise.  Eclipse uses a tool to externalize strings,
	to prevent this, strings need a comment "//$NON-NLS-1$".

	This also incorporated some fixes by Alex Chapiro, in 
	Spawner.Reaper Thread an exception can be thrown for
	example if the application does not exist, the reaper
	thread will catch the IOException an notify spawner of
	the failure by setting pid = -1;

	* utils/../utils/pty/PTYInputStream.java (close0):
	Advertise that we can throw an IOException.
	* utils/../utils/pty/PTYOutputStream.java (close): Put
	the "$NON-NLS-1$" magic.
	(write0): Advertise we can throw IOException.
	(close0): Advertise we can throw IOException.
	* utils/../utils/spawner/ProcessFactory.java: Reformat.
	* utils/../utils/spawner/Spawner.java (Reaper):
	The run method when calling exec0 did not catch the exception.
	And the waitFor() should not be done on a pid == -1; 
	* utils/../utils/spawner/SpawnerInputStream.java: Reformat.
	* utils/../utils/spawner/SpawnerOutputStream.java: Reformat.

	By making the native methods package scope, the
	compiler will not generate synthetic accessor
	methods to access them in the Reaper inner class

	* utils/../utils/spawner/Spawner.java (exec0):
	(exec1): Change scope to be package.
	(raise): Change scope to be package.
	(waitFor): Change scope to be package.

	* model/../core/model/CoreModel.java
	* model/../internal/core/model/CModelManager.java

	Clean up model 
		- removed plugin and nature id from model

	* src/../internal/core/CBuilder.java
	
	Fixed builder to return referenced projects so that eclipse 
	builder will build increamentaly build projects when they change.
	Handle "clean" target as special so the build state is cleared allowing
	the next increamental build to come in as a full build.
