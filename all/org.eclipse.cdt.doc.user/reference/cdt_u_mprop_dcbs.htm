<h1>C/C++ Project Properties, Managed, C/C++ Build, Build Steps</h1>
Customizes the selected build configuration allowing the specification
of user defined build command steps, as well as a descriptive message
to be displayed in the
build output, immediately prior to and immediately after normal build
processing executes.

<h2>Detailed Specification</h2>
<p>To ensure reasonable custom build step behavior, sensible input must
be provided when specifying custom build step input. Custom build steps
are not verified for correctness in any regard and are passed exactly
as entered into the build stream. <br>
<br>
In the descriptive text, below, the term "main build" is defined as the
sequence of commands to be executed when a build is invoked, not
including pre-build or post-build steps.<br>
<br>
The pre-build step is not executed if the state of the main build is
determined to be up to date; otherwise it is executed. An attempt to
execute the main build will occur regardless of the success or failure
of executing the pre-build step.
<br>
<br>
The post-build step is not executed if the state of the main build is
determined to be up to date. It will be executed only if the main-build
has executed successfully. </p>
