<h1>CDT projects</h1>

<p>Before you can work in the CDT, you must create a project to store your 
source code, makefiles, binaries, and related files. C/C++ projects are displayed 
in the C/C++ Projects view.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> Nested projects are not supported. Each project must be organized as a 
discrete entity. Project dependencies are supported by allowing a project 
to reference other projects that reside in your workspace. For more information, 
see <a href="../tasks/cdt_t_proj_ref.htm">Selecting referenced projects</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about projects and where they are stored, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Tasks &gt; Resources</b></li>
  <li> <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Tasks &gt; Running Eclipse</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Project types</h2>

<p>You can create a C or C++ project.</p>

<p>To build your project, you can either create your own makefile,
or let CDT generate the makefiles for you automatically.</p>

<p>You can toggle these modes (generate makefiles or not) 
at any time for existing project. Use <a href="../reference/cdt_o_proj_prop_pages.htm">properties.</a> </p>

<h2>Project conversion</h2>

<p>You can convert projects from C to C++ (or from C++ to C).  If, for 
example, your requirements change and you must convert an existing C project to C++, 
you can do this without recreating the project.  The CDT converts your project files and 
resolves any source control issues.</p>

<h2>A few notes about projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When you create a file within a project, a record (local history) of 
  every change is created. For more information about local history, see 
  <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Reference &gt; User interface 
  information &gt; Development environment &gt; Local history</b>.</li>
  <li>Spaces in projects and filenames can cause problems with some 
tools, such as the make utility or the compiler.</li>
  <li>Be careful when you use only case to distinguish files and projects. UNIX-based 
  operating system file names are case sensitive, but Windows filenames are not. Therefore, Hello.c and 
hello.c are separate files in UNIX but overwrite each other in Windows.</li>
</ul>
