	<intro>The CDT project provides a set of plugins that implement a C/C++ IDE.
It adds a C/C++ Perspective to the Eclipse Workbench that supports C/C++ development
with a number of views, wizards, a powerful editor, and a debugger. The CDT is designed
to provide an extensible architecture, that will provide support for integration of tools
provided by Independent Software Vendors.
