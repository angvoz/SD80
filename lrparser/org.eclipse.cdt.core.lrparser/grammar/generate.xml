<project name="CDT Extensible LR Parser Framework" basedir=".">

	<!--
		Common tasks that can be used to generate a parser using LPG and the
		LR parser framework.
		
		There are two ANT properties that must be defined:
		1) lpg_exe - This property must be set to the full path to the LPG generator executable (lpg.exe).
	    2) lpg_template - This property must be set to the full path to the folder that contains the LRParserTemplate.g file.
	
		Additionally if the $Import or $Include directives are being used in a grammar
		file then the LPG_INCLUDE environment variable must be set to the directory
		of the files being included.
	-->
	
	<fail unless="lpg_exe">
		Property $${lpg_exe} not set.
		This property must be set to the full path to the LPG generator executable.
	</fail>
		
	<fail unless="lpg_template">
		Property $${lpg_template} not set.
		This property must be set to the full path to the LPG templates folder.

	Parameters: 
	${grammar_dir} - directory that contains the grammar files
