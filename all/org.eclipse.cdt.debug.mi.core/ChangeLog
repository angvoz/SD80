	cdi/ExpressionManager.java:  Not needed, removed.

	The Eclipse/UI/Debug framewok is being very repetive
	and each command can be ask 2, 3 times.  So we'll try
	to make certain commands smarter by not reissuing them
	to gdb if the state is the same.  We do this when
	selecting the thread and when selecting the stackframe.
	
	The other problem is that Eclipse/UI/Debug is calling
	ICDISession.terminate() twice, this is catch by looking
	at isTerminated().

	* cdi/CThread.java (setCurrentStackFrame): Make it smarter
	to not reselect the stack level if it is already at that
	level.

	* MISession.java (isTerminated): Declare a flag that will
	hold the state.
	(terminate): Check if it was call already.
