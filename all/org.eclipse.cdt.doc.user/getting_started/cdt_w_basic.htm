<h2>Tutorial: Creating a simple application</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use the CDT to create a simple 'Hello World' application.
This tutorial describes the process of creating a new C++ project where the build is
automatically managed by the CDT.</p>

<p>Note: In earlier versions of the CDT, there were two separate project types:
Managed make (automatically generated a makefile)
and Standard make (required the user's makefile to build).
With CDT 4.0, you now select a project type, and that determines what build system will be used.</p>

<p>To create a simple "Hello World" application using the CDT, you will perform the following steps:</p>

<h3> Step 1: Creating a project</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b>.</p>
	<p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic02.png')">Click here to see an illustration (displayed in a separate window)</a>.</p><br></li>

	<li>Select the type of project to create. For this tutorial, expand the <b>C++</b> folder and select <b>C++ Project</b> and click <b>Next</b>.
	<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic03a.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a><br></p>
	<p><br>The <b>C++ Project</b> wizard opens.</p>
	<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic04.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a><br></p>
    <p><br>By default, the CDT filters the <b>Toolchain</b> and <b>Project types</b> that it displays in those lists based on the language support for the C++ Project wizard you selected for this tutorial.</p>
    </li><br>
    <li><p>In the <b>Project name</b> field, type a name for the project.</p>
    <br>
    <li><p>From the <b>Project types</b> list, expand <b>Executable</b> and select <b>Hello World C++ Project</b>. This project type provides a simple Hello World application in C++, and the makefile is automatically created by the CDT.</p>
	<br>
    <li><p>Select a required toolchain from the <b>Toolchain</b> list.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A toolchain is a set of tools (such as a compiler, linker, and assembler) intended to build your project.
    Additional tools, such as a debugger, can be associated with a toolchain.
    There can be several toolchains available, depending on the compilers installed on your system.</p>
    <br>
    <li><p>Click <b>Next</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Select Configurations window displays a list of configurations based on the project type and toolchain(s) you selected earlier.
    <br>
    <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic07.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a></p>
    <br>
    <li><p>Optional: If you want to change the default project settings, click <b>Advanced Settings</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This opens the project properties dialog for your new project allowing you change any of the project specific settings,
    such as includes paths, compiler options, and libraries.</p>
    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic21.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a></p>
    <br>
	<li>If you clicked <b>Next</b> at Step 6, you can specify the basic properties for the new project, such as your name, copyright, and source information.</p>
	<p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_basic22.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a></p>
	<br>
    <li><p>Click <b>Finish</b>.</p>
    <br>
	<li><p>If the <b>C++ perspective</b> is not currently set as the default, you are prompted to determined if you would like to this project to be associated with the C/C++ perspective. Click <b>Yes</b>.
	<br><p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="newWin('../images/cdt_w_cpp_perspectx.png')">Click here to see an illustration.</a></p>
	<br>
	<p>A project is created with the default settings and a full set of configurations based on the project type and toolchain you selected.
	You should now see the new project in C/C++ Projects view.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Creating a new file for the project</h3>
<p>Now, you will create a new .cpp file (such as main.cpp) that will contain some code that you will copy from another file into an editor. </p>

<ol>
	<li>Right-click on your project in the Navigator.
	<li>Select <b>New &gt; Source File</b>.
	<p>You should now see the new project in the C/C++ Projects view under the project, and the new file opens in the <b>Editor</b> view.</p>
</ol>  

<h3>Step 3: Enter and step through the code</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the code from the file <a href="javascript:void(0)"
 onclick="newWin('hw_example.htm')" title="here">main.cpp</a>
file that was just created.
<p>
You can double click the <b>main.cpp</b> tab in the <b>Editor</b>
view to expand the view. <br>
<i>Note: Leave a blank line at the end of the code because it is required by some compilers.</i></p>
<p>On the tab in the <b>Editor</b> view, an asterisk character ("*") prefixes the file name. The asterisk indicates that the file has changed but has not been saved.</p>
	<li>Notice that the <b>Outline</b> view has also been populated
with objects created from your code. </p>
<p>If you select an item from the <b>Outline</b> view, the
corresponding text in the editor is highlighted.
<li>Save the main.cpp file by clicking <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">File &gt; Save</span> or pressing <b>CTRL+S</b>.
<li>Build your project by pressing <b>CTRL+B</b>.</p>
<p>You can read through the build messages in the <b>Console</b> view.
The project should build successfully, showing the following message:</p>
<p><tt>Finished building target: HelloWorld.exe</tt></p>
<br>
<p>You will also see the <b>Outline</b> view has also been populated
with objects created from your code. </p>
<p>If you select an item from the <b>Outline</b> view, the
corresponding text in the editor is highlighted.</p></li>
</ol>  

<h3>Step 4: Running the application</h3>
<ol>
	<li>To run your application within the C/C++ Perspective, click <b>Run &gt; Run...</b>
	<li>Select <b>C/C++ Local Application</b>.
	<li>Click <b>'New'</b>.
<li>Click <b>'New'</b>.</p>

<p>A new Run Configuration is created. Its name and path to executable are provided by the project ('HelloWorld' in our case). 

<li>Click <b>'Run'</b>.
</ol>  

<h3>Step 5: Reviewing and interpreting the results in the Console view</h3>
<p>Now, you should now see the Hello World application running in the <b>Console</b> view.  
The <b>Console</b> also shows which application is running in a title bar.  
You can configure this view to display different elements (such as user input elements) using different colors.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Type in your name and press Enter.
	<p>The title bar in the <b>Console</b> view shows you when the program has terminated.</p>

	<li>You can click the other views to see the information that they contain.
</ol>
