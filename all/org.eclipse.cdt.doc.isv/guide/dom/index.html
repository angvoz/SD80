<h1>CDT DOM</h1>
<p>What is a DOM? Well, let me tell you. The DOM, or Document Object
Model, is a programmatic way to see the underlying source code in both
a syntactic and semantic view using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and
to allow changes in the AST to be reflected back out to the source
code.<br>
</p>
<h2>Syntactic View</h2>
<p>The syntactic view (which we sometimes call the physical view)
represents the syntactic structure of the program. This is driven
mainly by the grammar that the parser follows, mapping from terminals
up to the entry rule in the grammer. This view fulfills the role of a
traditional Abstract Syntax Tree, and you'll see that the classes that
make up this view have AST in their name.<br>
</p>
<h2>Semantic View</h2>
<p>The semantic view (which we sometimes call the logical view)
represent semantic elements in the program. These elements are
generally types, variables, and functions. The JDT calls these things
bindings, so we do to. However, the more general rule is that anything
that links sub-branches of the AST is a binding.<br>
</p>
<h2>Workspace-Wide View</h2>
<p>Once you have a binding, it is possible to find all translation
units that declare or refer to that binding.</p>
<h2>Rewriting</h2>
<p>From the Syntactic view, you can ask the AST Rewriter to calculate
the TextEdits required to accomplish changes to the AST.<br>
