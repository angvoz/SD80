	I added a fix for critical bug 43439. The new project wizard is ready to be hooked 
	up to the help system content on F1. There is a new file with the string constant 
	the doc project will use to map the widget to a help file.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/CProjectPlatformPage.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/ManagedBuilderHelpContextIds.java
	
	In support of the fix for critical bug 43292, I added a new set of widgets to 
	the ManageConfigDialog implementation. I added new string literals in the properties 
	file for the plugin. There are obviously new event handlers for the Manage dialog. 
	It displays the make command for the target, the name of the build artifact, and 
	a list of current and deleted configurations. There is no way to add new targets. 
	Users can restore deleted configurations up until they click OK. The client of this 
	dialog has been changed to properly respond to the changes. The NewConfigurationDialog 
	now displays an externalized string in the title bar.
	* plugin.xml
	* plugin.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/PluginResources.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuildPropertyPage.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/ManageConfigDialog.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/NewConfigurationDialog.java

	Removed the binary parser selection tab from the new class wizard. Updated the
	page description externalized string.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/PluginResources.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/NewManagedProjectOptionPage.java
	
	Added the hard-coded binary parser info to the defined targets.
	* plugin.xml
	
	Fixed the event handling for add/remove in the list widget for build settings pages.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuildOptionListFieldEditor.java

	Changed the initialization and button status logic so the list buttons are 
	enabled correctly on start-up and that the fist item in the list (if 
	any) is selected. Also changed the "Add" event handler to properly enable 
	the buttons and set the list selection.
	
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuildOptionListFieldEditor.java

2003-09-15 Sean Evoy
	First submission of code to new project. Moved all the managed 
	builder-specific UI elements out of the cdt.ui project. This 
	includes the icons, and externalized strings.
	
	There are 2 new classes to handle the externalized strings and image 
	files:
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/PluginResources.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/ManagedBuilderUIPlugin.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/ManagedBuilderUIImages.java
	
	The property pages have been modified to use a mix of externalized 
	strings from the CUIPlugin and ManagedBuilderUIPlugin. The new project 
	wizard has been reimplemented using the new C project classes added by 
	QNX September 12, 2003. The UI itself has not changed.
