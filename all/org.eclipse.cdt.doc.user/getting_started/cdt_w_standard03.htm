<h3>C/C++ Perspective</h3>

<p>This is the C/C++ Perspective, notice the C/C++ Projects view on the left, and the Outline view has moved to the right.  The center area is reserved for your <b>Edit</b> view.</p>
<p>There may be other views available in your workbench such as the <b>Navigator</b> or <b>Make Targets</b> views.  You can close them if you wish; they will not be used in this tutorial.  
You can open them again later by clicking <b>Window > Show View</b> and reselecting them.
