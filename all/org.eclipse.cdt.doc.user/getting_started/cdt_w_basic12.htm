<h3>New Project Files</h3>

<p>You should now see the new file located in the Projects View under the project, and the new file should be open in the <b>Editor</b> view.</p> 
<p>If <b>Build Automatically</b> is selected you may also notice some build errors in the <b>Console</b> view, this is expected since your project is currently blank, 
you may also see a few other objects such as <b>Debug</b> depending on your Makefile configuration. To turn this feature off click <b>Project > Build Automatically</b>.</p>
