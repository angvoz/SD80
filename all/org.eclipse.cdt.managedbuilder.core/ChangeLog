	Changed the implementor of IScannerInfo to answer only absolute paths when asked for 
	includes paths. Users will specify the includes paths in the managed build UI in such a way
	that the compiler will not complain. Either they will use absolute paths, or they will specify 
	them relative to the build directory. In the second case, it is easier for the managed builder 
	to convert the paths relative to this directory into absolute paths before replying tha it is for 
	the client to figure this out.

	All the work in this patch is for critical bug 43292. In order to manage 
	configurations, there had to be a method through ITarget to remove 
	configurations. Also, to support the naming of newly created configurations, 
	I added a name method to the IConfiguration interface. Finally, the ITarget 
	needed to support setting (and resetting) the make command to use when building.

	Added a new field to the target specification in the build model to 
	hard-code the binary parser for project creation. There is a new getter 
	method in the interface and the implementor contains additional code to 
	extract the information from a project file or plugin manifest. The 
	interface also contains new strings to make changing the specification 
	easier in the future.

	Fix for bug 41720: libraries are now found for Solaris and Linux 
	executables. The problem was the executable had no extension and 
	the client of the build model passed null instead of the empty string.

	Patch contains a fix for bug 43017. Renamed the "addDeps" method to a 
	more descriptive "addSourceDependencies". Added a flag when the 
	inter-project dependencies are calculated so that clean and all are 
	properly passed to the make invocation. Finally, I replaced the hard-coded
	'make' with $(MAKE)
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/MakefileGenerator.java
	
	It also contains some more work on 41826, specifically on the logic to
	implement a rebuild when the build settings change. The builder checks for 
	a build model change whenever a build is requested and responds appropriately. 
	The make targets (i.e. 'clean' and 'all') are also calculated differently now.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/GeneratedMakefileBuilder.java
	
	The build model was modified to set a dirty flag when an option changes. I also
	made a change to avoid an NPE when the build info was loaded.

	First submission of code to new project. Moved the managed builder 
	source code out of the cdt.core project. This includes the code to 
	implement the build model, along with the shema and extension point 
	declaration. Moved the builder, scnanaer info provider and managed 
	nature definitions into the package as well.
	
	There are 2 new classes to handle the externalized strings:
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuilderCorePlugin.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/PluginResources.properties
