	Runtime.getRuntime().exec(..) would throw an exception
	if the program does not exist or is not an executabe.
	Spawner should do the same.
	
	library/pfind.c (pfind): Check also for fullpath
	with access() system call.

	library/exec_unix.c (exec0): Always call pfind()
	to check if the program exists.
	
	os/linux/x86/libspawner.so: Rebuild.
