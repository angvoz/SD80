	Removed the binary parser selection tab from the new class wizard. Updated the
	page description externalized string.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/PluginResources.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/NewManagedProjectOptionPage.java
	
	Added the hard-coded binary parser info to the defined targets.
	* plugin.xml
	
	Fixed the event handling for add/remove in the list widget for build settings pages.
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuildOptionListFieldEditor.java

	Changed the initialization and button status logic so the list buttons are 
	enabled correctly on start-up and that the fist item in the list (if 
	any) is selected. Also changed the "Add" event handler to properly enable 
	the buttons and set the list selection.
	
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuildOptionListFieldEditor.java

	First submission of code to new project. Moved all the managed 
	builder-specific UI elements out of the cdt.ui project. This 
	includes the icons, and externalized strings.
	
	There are 2 new classes to handle the externalized strings and image 
	files:
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/PluginResources.properties
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/ManagedBuilderUIPlugin.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/ManagedBuilderUIImages.java
	
	The property pages have been modified to use a mix of externalized 
	strings from the CUIPlugin and ManagedBuilderUIPlugin. The new project 
	wizard has been reimplemented using the new C project classes added by 
	QNX September 12, 2003. The UI itself has not changed.
