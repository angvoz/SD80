<h1>What's new</h1>

<p>Find out what's new in CDT 1.2.</p>

<h2>C/C++ Search</h2>
<p>You can search the projects in your workspace for references to, declarations 
or definitions of, particular elements. Only header files referenced by a source 
file in your workspace are included in a search.</p>
<h2>Build</h2>
<h3>Managed build</h3>
<p>You can now create a Managed build and have makefiles generated for you.</p>
<h3>Error parser</h3>
<p>The error parsers are now extension-points that can contributed by other 
plugins. The error parsers are used to detect errors or warnings or 
informational messages from compilers, linkers, etc... during a build.</p>
<h3>New Global preferences for all Standard Make Project properties</h3>
<h4>Make builder options</h4>
<p>Support changing/enabling default make targets for each workbench build type. 
New default build location setting.</p>
<h4>Make project options</h4>
<p>New user settable error parser configuration. User can enable/disable and 
change older of the build error parsers used during the project build.</p>
<p>New Includes paths and Preprocessor symbols entry to allow proper indexing 
and search of the project.</p>
<h4>Make target</h4>
<p>Make targets now support Stop on error build option and ability to change the 
default build command.</p>
<h4>New Standard Make projects</h4>
<p>Old Standard Make projects will be automatically updated to support the new 
options. If update is declined, then selecting Update Old Make project... from 
the context menu of the project will update the project to a new Standard Make 
project.</p>
<h2>Debug</h2>
<h3>Formatting of variables and expressions</h3>
<p>You can now select the number system (natural, decimal, hexadecimal) used to display 
variables and expressions.</p>
<h3>Variable view, detail pane</h3>
<p>In the Variable view, a detail pane has been 
added to let you see the value of a selected variable. This is practical when 
looking at a string (char *).</p>
<h3>Casting of variables, expressions and registers</h3>
<p>In the Variable view, a variable can be cast to a different type or be restored to 
its original type. Also, a pointer can be cast to an array type.</p>
<h3>Debug disable variable query</h3>
<p>The value of variables are queried at every step.</p>
<p>This can be time-consuming on certain embedded targets. The automatic 
query of variables can be disabled. Manual queries are now an option.</p>
<h2>Source location</h2>
<p>A new source locator in the Run/Debug dialog box makes it possible to add directories 
to search, mapping, and the order of the search.</p>
<h3>GDB/MI new shared library launch pane</h3>
<p>For GDB/MI code, two new actions are added in the launch view, stop-on-solib 
and auto-load-symbols. Stop-on-solib will force the debugger to stop on any 
shared library events. Auto load will load the symbols for any shared library.</p>
<h3>GDB/MI improvements in display of arrays</h3>
<p>Arrays are now separated into ranges, to limit the possibility of a timeout 
on large arrays.</p>
