	First submission of code to new project. Moved the managed builder 
	source code out of the cdt.core project. This includes the code to 
	implement the build model, along with the shema and extension point 
	declaration. Moved the builder, scnanaer info provider and managed 
	nature definitions into the package as well.
	
	There are 2 new classes to handle the externalized strings:
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuilderCorePlugin.java
	* src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/PluginResources.properties
