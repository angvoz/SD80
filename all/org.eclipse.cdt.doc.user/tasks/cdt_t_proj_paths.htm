<h1>Adding Include paths and symbols</h1>
<p>For CDT projects you can define include paths and
preprocessor symbols for the parser. This enables the parser to
understand the contents of the C/C++ source code so that you may more
effectively use the search and code completion features. </p>

<p>If Autodiscovery is enabled once a build has completed any
discovered paths and symbols will be displayed in the Discoverd Paths
section. You can also define the properties on a per project basis in
the C/C++ Projects or Navigator views.</p>
<p>To add include paths and symbols:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To set properties for your project right click your CDT
project and select <b>Properties</b>. Alternatively, to set properties
for a specific source file in your project right click a source file
within your standard make project and select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Properties</span>. </li>
  <li>Click <b>C/C++ Include Paths and Symbols</b>.<br>

  </li>
  <li>Use "Export" button to make selected element (Include Path, Symbol, Library path etc) exported.
  </li>
  <li>Use "Unexport" button to remove selected element (Include Path, Symbol, Library path etc) from export list.
