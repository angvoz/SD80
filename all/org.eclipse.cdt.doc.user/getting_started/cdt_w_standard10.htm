<h3>Paths and Symbols</h3>
<p>Click the <b>Paths and Symbols</b> tab, you can define include paths and preprocessor symbols for the parser. 
This enables the parser to understand the contents of the C/C++ source 
code so that you may more effectively use the search and code completion 
features. Include paths are also used by the builder to locate files that 
are not in the workspace.</p>
