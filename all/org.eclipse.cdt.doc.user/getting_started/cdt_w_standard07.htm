<h3>Make Builder Settings</h3>

<p>Click the <b>Make Builder</b> tab.  Depending on your operating environment, you may need to change your <b>Build Command</b> from default.  Deselect the<b> Use default</b> checkbox and
enter the build command in the text box. It is recommended you leave the <b>Build on resource save</b> unchecked, otherwise whenever a file is 
saved in your project the project will perform a build which can become time consuming for large projects.</p>
