	There are some serious problems with gdb/mi, for example
	the most recurrent one is when using -data-disassemble
	in a threaded program, GNU/Linux uses a thread manager
	when trying to access the stackframe, gdb usually coredumps
	with an assert, it goes something like this:
	
-data-disassemble -f manager.c -l 136 -n 100 0
&"Cannot access memory at address 0x4002d794\n"
^error,msg="Cannot access memory at address 0x4002d794"
(gdb) 
-data-disassemble -s 0x4002d900 -e 0x4002d964 0
&"Cannot access memory at address 0x4002d900\n"
^error,msg="Cannot access memory at address 0x4002d900"
(gdb) 
-thread-select 2
&"ui-out.c:133: gdb-internal-error: push_level: Assertion `uiout->level >= 0 && uiout->level < MAX_UI_OUT_LEVELS' failed.\n"

	The RxThread will spawn a thread to terminate the session
	and clear the receiving queue.


	* RxThread.java (run): When the thread is being cancel() or
	running out of run(), clear the receiving queue(rxQueue) and
	notify any commands waiting.

	* TxTread.java (run): Before putting the command in the
	receiving queue(rxQueue) check to see if the thread is
	still running.
	When the thread is being cancel() or running out of run(),
	clear the transmition queue(txQueue) an notify any commands
	waiting.

	* Queue.java (clearItems): New method that clear the items
	on the queue and returning them.

	* CommandQueue.java (clearCommands): New method calls super.clearItems()
	whith the appropriate castings.

	* cdi/CThread.java (setCurrentStackFrame): Check for null.

	The memory block is implemented with
	-data-read-memory (MIDataReadMemory)
	Since the ICDIMemoryBlock only have
	byte[] getBytes()
	We will always issue:
	-data-read-memory address x 1 1 length
	The CDI upper layer will deal with any conversions
	
	The problem now is how to send changedEvent when
	an element of the memory changed.
	
	* cdi/MemoryBlock.java (getLength): Implemented
	(getBytes): Implemented
	(getStartAddress): Implemented

	* cdi/MemoryManager.java: Implemented.
	
	* command/MIDataReadMemory (getMIDataReadMemoryInfo):
	New helper method.

	* cdi/Location (getInstructions): Methods removed
	no longer define in ICDILocation.

	* cdi/SourceManager (getMixedInstruction):
	Implement the 3 new methods to return Mixed source
	and assemby instructions.
	
	* cdi/MixedInstruction: New class implements
	ICDIMixedInstruction.

	The Eclipse/UI/Debug framewok is being very repetive
	and each command can be ask 2, 3 times.  So we'll try
	to make certain commands smarter by not reissuing them
	to gdb if the state is the same.  We do this when
	selecting the thread and when selecting the stackframe.
	
	The other problem is that Eclipse/UI/Debug is calling
	ICDISession.terminate() twice, this is catch by looking
	at isTerminated().

	* cdi/CThread.java (setCurrentStackFrame): Make it smarter
	to not reselect the stack level if it is already at that
	level.

	* MISession.java (isTerminated): Declare a flag that will
	hold the state.
	(terminate): Check if it was call already.

	* SourceManager.java:  Implement getInstructions().
