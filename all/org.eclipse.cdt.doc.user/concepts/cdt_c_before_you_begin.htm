<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<p>Depending on how you obtained the CDT, you might have also received
a toolchain with a built-in CDT integration.
However, if you downloaded the CDT from the Eclipse repository, then you will require a toolchain before
you can build and debug any projects.</p>

<p>The standard CDT supports integration with the GNU toolchain.
This includes GNU's make, gcc compiler, and gdb debugger utilities.
If you require a toolchain to build software for your development host, this
is the best choice to get started.

<p>Each platform that runs the CDT requires different steps to acquire this toolchain.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>For windows, MinGW and Cygwin are the two main platform choices for acquiring the GNU toolchain.
It is important to understand the difference between them.
Cygwin produces executables that use the Cygwin POSIX runtime. Note that this runtime is GPL licensed.
MinGW produces native Windows executables that do not require a separate runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <strong>MinGW</strong>, the recommended method to get the toolchain is to install it
from the Wascana project at Eclipse Labs,
<a href="http://www.eclipselabs.org/p/wascana">http://www.eclipselabs.org/p/wascana</a>.
Wascana includes the MinGW toolchain as well as a number of open source libraries that can be used
for Windows development.
See the Wascana site for installation instructions.</p><br>
<p>As an alternative, the MinGW site itself, <a href="http://www.mingw.org">http://www.mingw.org</a>
also has an installer. The CDT will find that install if it is placed in the default C:\MinGW
directory.</p></li><br>
<li><p><strong>Cygwin</strong> can be install from the Cygwin site at
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>. You need to manually select
the gcc, gdb, and make packages to install the toolchain.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>All Linux distributions include the GNU toolchain. They may not, however, be installed by default.
For instructions about installing the GNU toolchain for Linux, see the instructions for your particular distribution.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
The CDT supports the Apple GNU toolchain that is included in with the Xcode IDE. It can be downloaded
from the Apple's developer site, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">http://developer.apple.com</a>

<h3>Other Platforms</h3>
<p>The GNU toolchain is supported on all platforms that the CDT supports. For instructions about installing the GNU toolchain
on your platform, see your platform vendor.</p>
