<h1>GDB Debugging Preferences</h1>

<p>This preferences page lets you control how the CDT debugger behaves when debugging with GDB, 
specifically when using a <em>GDB (DSF)</em> launcher. 
The page is accessible at:
<strong>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; C/C++ &gt; Debug &gt; GDB</strong>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Enable GDB traces</dt>
  <dd>When checked, the debug session will produce an additional console which will contain all the gdb/mi activity. Basically, this details the 
  interaction between the CDT debugger and GDB. This information is often critical when the debugger is not behaving as you expect. Turn this on and submit
  the console output when submitting a bugzilla report against the CDT debugger. 
  </dd>
  <dt>Terminate GDB when last process exits</dt>
  <dd>When checked, the CDT debugger will terminate the GDB host processs after all the target processes it is debugging have terminated. Otherwise it will leave it running.</dd>
  <dt>Use enhanced debug hover</dt>
  <dd>When checked, hovering over an expression in the editor during a debug session will bring up an <em>enhanced</em> expression evaluation control. Otherwise, a more basic control is used. This, of course, assumes that you have the debugger's hovering capability turned on in C/C++ > Editor > Hovers. If not, this checkbox has no effect.<br>
