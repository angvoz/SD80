****
This MI implementation is base on GDB/MI 5.2.1.

To create an MISession an InputStream and OutputStream are
needed(assuming this the pipe connected to gdb).
	MISession MIPlugin.createSession(InputStream, OutputStream);
During initialisation of the session(MISession) two threads
are created(TxThread, RxThread). MI Commands created via the CommandFactory
are added to the TxQueue, the TxThread will then wake up
generate a token(ID) for the command and send it the pipe(gdb), after
transmission the command is then move to the RxQueue waiting for the 
result(MIResultRecord).

Any responses will wake the RxThread, the thread would parse
the response constructing an MIOutput then search the RxQueue
for any commands with the same token waking any thread waiting
for a synchronous response(MIResultRecord).  Any out-of-band
responses(MIOOBRecord) are dispatch, clients interested in those
notifications should register to MISession.
