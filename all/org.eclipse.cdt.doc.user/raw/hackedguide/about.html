<p>This book is organized so you can learn what you need to know quickly and easily. Each chapter has these common sections:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>The overview gives you a quick synopsis of what you're about to learn.  
	</li>
<li>The suggested reading section tells you what you should know before starting each chapter.
 	</li>
<li>The related information section gives you a quick list of the supporting material, including tutorials and movies. Some are marked "recommended."
	</li>
<li>The "How ... works" section gives you an idea of what's happening "underneath the covers" -- how the IDE, the host, and the target work together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorials are in a separate guide so you can print and use them side by side with the corresponding chapters in this guide.</p>
<p>

 </p>
