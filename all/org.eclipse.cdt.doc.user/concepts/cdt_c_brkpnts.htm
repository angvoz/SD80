<h1>Breakpoints</h1>

<p>A breakpoint suspends the execution of a thread at the location where the breakpoint is set.
To set a breakpoint, right-click in the frame on the left side of an editor beside
the line where you want the breakpoint, then choose <b>Add Breakpoint</b>.
</p>
<p>Once set, a breakpoint can be enabled and disabled by right-clicking on its icon or by
right-clicking on its description in the <b>Breakpoints</b> view.
</p>

<ul>
<li>When a breakpoint is enabled, it causes a thread to suspend whenever it is hit. 
Enabled breakpoints are indicated with a blue  
<img src="../images/icon_breakpoint_obj.gif" alt="enabled breakpoint" border="0"> circle. 
Enabled breakpoints that are successfully installed 
are indicated with a checkmark overlay.</li>
<li>When a breakpoint is disabled, it will not cause threads to suspend. 
Disabled breakpoints are indicated with a white
