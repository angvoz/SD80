	Fix Pr 26005
	* library/spawner/spawner.c (waitFor):
	The waitFor(int) JNI on QNX is returning the PID of the
	process rather then the status of the process
	on exit.
	Patch from Chris Mckillop.

	* library/spawner.c (exec0) :  This function was
	leaking memory at every call, the environment array
	and the argument array was not free().  There is no
	need to do the strdup() of cwd.
